# Data-Analysis
This portfolio showcases the skills I gained while learning Data Analysis over the past two years: exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Python, machine learning models, SQL projects, and Power BI reports. The repository groups projects into clear folders with documentation and reproducible code.

# About

I am **Mariana Straulea**, an analytical and dedicated **undergraduate student in Economics**, channeling a strong passion for data into practical Machine Learning and Data Analysis projects.

While pursuing my degree, I have dedicated the past two years to intensive self-study and practical application, building a robust technical foundation through top-tier programs, including **CS50 (Python, SQL)**, the **Google Analytics Professional Advanced Certificate**, and the **IBM Data Science Specialization**.

My background in Economics allows me to approach data problems with a crucial **business context**, enabling me to derive insights that are strategically relevant and actionable.

### Core Competencies:

| Domain | Key Tools and Techniques |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Science & ML** | Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), Random Forest, Hyperparameter Tuning |
| **Data Visualization & Reporting** | Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Advanced Google Analytics |
| **Database & Scripting** | SQL (Relational Database Query Design), Python Scripting |
| **Languages** | Advanced English, Intermediate German, Native Romanian |

This portfolio showcases the technical skills and project-based experience gained over this period. I am committed to continuous learning and eager to transition into a professional data role.
