# Data-Analysis
This portfolio showcases the skills I gained while learning Data Analysis over the past two years: exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Python, machine learning models, SQL projects, and Power BI reports. The repository groups projects into clear folders with documentation and reproducible code.

# About

I am **Mariana Straulea**, an analytical and dedicated **undergraduate student in Economics**, channeling a strong passion for data into practical Machine Learning and Data Analysis projects.

While pursuing my degree, I have dedicated the past two years to intensive self-study and practical application, building a robust technical foundation through top-tier programs, including **CS50 (Python, SQL)**, the **Google Analytics Professional Advanced Certificate**, and the **IBM Data Science Specialization**.

My background in Economics allows me to approach data problems with a crucial **business context**, enabling me to derive insights that are strategically relevant and actionable.

### Core Competencies:

| Domain | Key Tools and Techniques |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Science & ML** | Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), Random Forest, Hyperparameter Tuning |
| **Data Visualization & Reporting** | Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Advanced Google Analytics |
| **Database & Scripting** | SQL (Relational Database Query Design), Python Scripting |
| **Languages** | Advanced English, Intermediate German, Native Romanian |

This portfolio showcases the technical skills and project-based experience gained over this period. I am committed to continuous learning and eager to transition into a professional data role.

## Portfolio Projects

### Python:
- Exploratory Data Analysis on Coffee Sales Dataset  
  - Short description: Performed EDA on a coffee sales dataset to uncover seasonal patterns, top-selling items, and customer behaviour. The project includes data cleaning, visualizations (Matplotlib/Seaborn), and actionable insights to inform sales and inventory decisions.  
  - Folder: [Data_Projects/Projects/EDA_coffe_sales](https://github.com/MarianaStraulea/Data-Analysis/tree/main/Data_Projects/Projects/EDA_coffe_sales)

- Heart Disease Prediction — Creating a ML model to predict the presence of heart disease  
  - Short description: Built and evaluated classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict heart disease using a public clinical dataset. The work includes preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation with ROC-AUC and confusion matrices.  
  - Folder: [Data_Projects/Projects/ML_Project_1](https://github.com/MarianaStraulea/Data-Analysis/tree/main/Data_Projects/Projects/ML_Project_1)

- Employee Attrition Prediction — Predicting turnover with Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms  
  - Short description: Developed models to predict employee attrition from HR data, including feature engineering (tenure, engagement metrics), class imbalance handling, and model interpretation. The deliverables include model performance metrics and HR policy recommendations to reduce turnover.  
  - Folder: [Data_Projects/Projects/Employee_Attrition](https://github.com/MarianaStraulea/Data-Analysis/tree/main/Data_Projects/Projects/Employee_Attrition)

### SQL:
- Bookstore Database  
  - Short description: Designed a normalized relational database for a bookstore, implemented sample schema and data, and wrote SQL queries for sales analytics and inventory reporting. The project demonstrates schema design, JOINs, aggregation, and reporting queries.  
  - Folder: [Data_Projects/Projects/Bookstore_Database/MarianaStraulea-final_project](https://github.com/MarianaStraulea/Data-Analysis/tree/main/Data_Projects/Projects/Bookstore_Database/MarianaStraulea-final_project)
